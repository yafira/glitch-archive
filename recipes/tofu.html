      <h4>Description</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        This General Tso’s Tofu is a healthier and lighter version of the
        classic General Tso’s Chicken. Besides, it’s made with tofu instead of
        chicken and the tofu is not deep-fried, just sautéed in a little bit of
        oil.
        <br />
        <br />
        For those of you who don’t know General Tso’s chicken, it’s a sweet,
        deep-fried chicken dish that is served in North American Chinese
        restaurants.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’ve used only a little bit of oil to cook the tofu and also made a less
        spicy version, but add as much oil and red pepper flakes as you want.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can also make this recipe oil-free (just read the pro tips or recipe
        notes) and omit the red pepper flakes if you’re not into spicy food.

      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <hr />
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place the tofu cubes in a bowl or shallow dish.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add the marinade ingredients (2 tbsp of tamari and 1 tbsp of apple
          cider vinegar), stir and let rest for at least 5 minutes, preferably
          overnight.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Drain the tofu and discard the marinade.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Transfer 1/3 of the tofu cubes to a freezer or plastic bag with 2 tbsp
          of cornstarch and toss to coat. Repeat this step with the rest of the
          tofu cubes and cornstarch. Add more cornstarch if needed.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Once the tofu cubes are coated with the cornstarch, heat some oil in a
          skillet and add the tofu cubes. I used extra virgin olive oil, but any
          oil will do.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the tofu cubes over medium-high heat until all sides are golden
          brown. Remove the tofu from the skillet and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the garlic to the skillet with a little bit of oil if needed and
          cook over medium-high heat for about 1 to 2 minutes, stirring
          frequently until golden brown. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix all the sauce ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the sauce to the skillet where you had your cooked garlic and cook
          over medium-high heat until it thickens, stirring frequently.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, add the tofu cubes, stir and cook for 1 to 2 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve with some cooked white rice and garnish with some sesame seeds
          and chopped chives (optional). Keep leftovers in an airtight container
          in the fridge for up to 5 days.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <hr />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Depending on your taste buds and the type or brand or vinegar you’re
          using, you may want to add less vinegar to the sauce. Some readers
          love the recipe just like this, but others prefer the sauce with less
          vinegar. Add only 1 tbsp of vinegar at first and add more vinegar if
          needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Firm or extra firm tofu works great. I’ve never tried to use soft or
          silken tofu myself, but I don’t think it’s going to work.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you don’t want to use a freezer or plastic bag, just add the
          cornstarch to a shallow dish, then the tofu cubes and toss to coat.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you don’t eat soy, you could use cauliflower instead. I’ve seen
          some recipes online, but I’ve never tried it myself. Tamari or soy
          sauce can be replaced by coconut aminos.
        </li>
        <li>
          For an oil-free version of this recipe, bake the tofu at 350ºF or
          180ºC until golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Feel free to use any type of vinegar, starch or sugar you have on
          hand.
        </li>
      </ul>
