      <h4>Description</h4>

      <p>
        This is an easy, 30-minute recipe with smoky, roasted cauliflower and a
        spicy romesco-inspired sauce*. It’s also plant-based, gluten-free, and
        oil-free optional and grain-free optional. I do a lot for you people! I
        must like you a lot (wink, wink).
        <br />
        While the cauliflower is roasting, make your sauce, which is comprised
        of roasted almonds, roasted and fresh garlic, fire-roasted tomatoes,
        lime juice, spices, chipotle peppers*, and a little maple syrup. The
        result is a smoky, tangy, spicy, well-balanced sauce that’s thick and
        creamy and perfect for these cauliflower tacos.

      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <hr />
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and add cauliflower to 2 large
          baking sheets (use more baking sheets if increasing batch size). Add
          oil (or omit/sub water), cumin, chili powder, paprika, and salt. Toss
          to combine and roast on the bottom rack for 20-25 minutes or until
          golden brown and tender.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          To a separate baking sheet, add raw almonds and the 4 unpeeled garlic
          cloves (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering
          batch size). Roast on the center rack for 10-12 minutes, checking at
          the 8 minute mark. If the almonds are dark brown and cracking, remove
          from the oven to avoid burning, but continue cooking garlic until
          light golden brown and slightly softened. Remove from oven and set
          aside.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          While cauliflower finishes roasting, add drained, fire-roasted
          tomatoes to a high-speed blender along with almonds, roasted garlic
          (peeled), raw garlic (peeled), oil (or water), lime juice, paprika,
          cumin, salt, maple syrup, and chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.
          Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lime for acidity,
          garlic for kick/zing, salt for saltiness, paprika or cumin for
          smokiness, maple syrup to offset heat/add sweetness, or chipotle
          peppers for more heat.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          To serve, warm tortillas in the microwave or in the oven directly on
          the still-warm oven racks until pliable. Then add 1-2 Tbsp of the
          romesco sauce and a generous portion of cauliflower. Serve as is or
          garnish with lime juice/wedges, cilantro, cabbage, and/or pepitas
          (optional).
        </li>
        <li>
          Best when fresh. Store leftover sauce in the refrigerator up to 1 week
          (or 1 month in the freezer), and the cauliflower in the refrigerator
          up to 3 days. Reheat cauliflower in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven until
          warm (best when fresh).
        </li>
      </ol>
