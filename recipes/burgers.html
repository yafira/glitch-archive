      <h4>Description</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The new generation of vegan meat alternatives, such as Impossible and
        Beyond, are at their best when still medium-rare and juicy. Flipping the
        patties frequently as they cook ensures an evenly cooked interior and
        good flavor development on the exterior. To make the burgers vegetarian,
        feel free to use any good melting cheese, such as American, Cheddar or
        Swiss, but to make them strictly vegan, be sure to look for vegan burger
        buns, as standard supermarket burger buns frequently contain milk or
        other dairy products.

      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>YIELD: 4 cheeseburgers</p>
      <p>TIME: 15 minutes</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pound vegan ground meat, such as Impossible or Beyond</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 slices vegan cheese, such as Cheddar-style</li>
        <li>4 vegan hamburger buns, lightly toasted</li>
        <li>Toppings and condiments, to taste</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <hr />
      <ol>
        <li>
          Divide vegan ground meat into 4 equal pieces. Pick up one piece,
          transfer to a cutting board, and use your hands to press and shape it
          into a patty about 1/4-inch wider than your bun. Repeat to form
          remaining patties. Put three fingers of one hand together, and press a
          shallow indentation into the center of each patty. Season with salt
          and pepper.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high until shimmering. Add
          patties and cook, flipping frequently, until well browned and an
          instant-read thermometer inserted into the coolest part of the center
          of the patty registers 120 to 125 degrees for medium-rare, or 130 to
          135 degrees for medium. Immediately add cheese slices to the top of
          the patties, and transfer them to a large plate.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Dress bottom buns as desired. Place a patty on top, and dress top bun
          as desired. Close cheeseburgers and serve.
        </li>
      </ol>
