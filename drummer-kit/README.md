# JavaScript Drum Kit

This drum kit was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses a Document Model Object (DOM) which is a programming API that provides an interface that can be used in a wide variety of environments and applications. DOM is used to represent many different kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, as data rather than a document.

# Objective

The JavaScript drum kit is designed to be played via predefined keys which are displayed on a webpage. The goal is to use JavaScript code in order to make the drum kit play and indicate which key you are pressing. The implementation of the drum kit also gives you the ability to interact with audio elements and learn about transitioned event.
