      <h4>Description</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        What sets this 8-ingredient lasagna apart from the rest is two things:
        Veggie ‘noodles’ and a brand new-to-me vegan ‘ricotta cheese.’ Have you
        guys tried macadamia nut ‘cheese’ yet? You know how I love my tofu
        ricotta, but this macadamia version is ridiculously easy (no soaking
        required!) and very close in flavor and texture to the real thing! Plus,
        it turns out all fluffy and cheesy and green from fresh basil. Ooh mama.

      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>YIELD: 9 squares</p>
      <p>PREP TIME: 20 minutes</p>
      <p>COOK TIME: 1 hour</p>
      <ul>
        <h4>VEGAN RICOTTA</h4>
        <li>
          3 cups raw macadamia nuts or soaked blanched almonds* (or 1 16-ounce
          block extra firm tofu*, drained and pressed dry for 10 minutes //
          amount of tofu is as original recipe is written // adjust if altering
          batch size)
        </li>
        <li>2 Tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh basil (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>
          1 medium lemon, juiced (~2 Tbsp or 30 ml as original recipe is
          written)
        </li>
        <li>
          1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil (optional // for flavor + richness)
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp sea salt + pinch black pepper</li>
        <li>
          1/2 cup water (plus more as needed // reduce if using tofu as it
          requires less)
        </li>
        <li>
          1/4 cup vegan parmesan cheese (optional // plus more for topping)
        </li>
        <h4>THE REST</h4>
        <li>
          1 28-ounce jar favorite marinara sauce (I like Trader Joe’s organic
          tomato basil)
        </li>
        <li>
          3 medium zucchini squash thinly sliced with a mandolin (or sub
          eggplant with this recipe as a guide)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <hr />
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (176 C).
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add macadamia nuts to a food processor or blender and mix to combine,
          scraping down sides as needed. You’re looking for a fine meal.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add remaining ingredients: Nutritional yeast, fresh basil, oregano,
          lemon juice, olive oil (optional), salt, pepper, water and vegan
          parmesan cheese (optional). You are looking for a well-puréed
          mixture/paste.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt and pepper for
          flavor, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, and lemon juice for
          brightness.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Pour about 1 cup (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if
          altering batch size) marinara sauce into a 9×13-inch (or similar size)
          baking dish and line with thinly sliced zucchini.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scoop small spoonfuls amounts of ricotta mixture over the zucchini and
          gently spread into a thin layer. Spread on a layer of marinara sauce
          and then top with more zucchini slices. Continue until all filling and
          zucchini are used up. The top two layers should be zucchini and then
          sauce. Sprinkle on vegan parmesan cheese (optional), and then cover
          with foil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake covered for 45 minutes, then remove foil and bake for 15 minutes
          more. The zucchini should be very easily pierced when cut with a
          knife. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before serving.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve immediately with additional vegan parmesan cheese and fresh
          basil. Leftovers keep for 2-3 days in the refrigerator, or in the
          freezer up to 1 month.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        *If subbing blanched almonds, soak in cold water overnight (or 6 hours),
        or in very hot water 1 hour. Then drain thoroughly and proceed with
        recipe as written. *If subbing tofu, make sure it’s firm (not silken).
        Adjust seasonings as needed as the tofu requires a little bit more
        nutritional yeast, salt and basil. *Nutrition information is a rough
        estimate calculated without vegan parmesan cheese or olive oil.
